<hr />

Fabrix is a framework for building React applications that are backed by GraphQL backend. 

# Features

* **Snappy DX** :heart: - Finally, all you need to do is just writing GraphQL! Free from repetitive tasks to ship your frontend to customers.
* **Just works with React app** :rocket: - Fabrix can work with any existing React app, and can be used with any GraphQL schema. See [Component API](https://fabrix-framework.github.io/docs/guides/component/) for more information.
* **Bring your own components** üõ†Ô∏è - Fabrix is designed to be agnostic to the components you use. You can use any component library, or [even build your own](https://fabrix-framework.github.io/docs/guides/component-registry/). We already have several component libraries that you can use out of the box.

# Quick start
